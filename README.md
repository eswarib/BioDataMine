**BioDataMine**

**Understand your medical datasets before you train.**

BioDataMine is a medical data intelligence platform designed to ingest, analyze, and visualize medical datasets, 
with a strong focus on medical imaging. It helps teams understand what is actually inside their data 
before starting model training, annotation, or deployment.

**Why BioDataMine?**

In medical AI, problems often start long before model training:

Unknown or mixed imaging modalities

Inconsistent anatomy coverage

Hidden dataset bias

Poor or missing metadata

Teams working on different dataset versions

BioDataMine solves this by making medical datasets transparent.

**What BioDataMine Does**

Given a dataset URL (public dataset, archive, or storage bucket), BioDataMine:

🔗 Downloads and stores the dataset (local or S3-compatible storage)

🧠 Inspects files and metadata automatically

🖼️ Identifies 2D images vs 3D volumes

🏥 Detects imaging modality (CT, MRI, X-ray, Ultrasound, Optical, etc.)

🧍 Infers anatomy (chest, brain, cranial, liver, breast, etc.)

📊 Visualizes dataset composition (modality %, anatomy distribution)

👥 Enables team-based dataset sharing and collaboration

The goal is simple:

Know your medical data before you train.
